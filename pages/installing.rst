There is another alternative way to install. It is Install Directory. To install with this method you need to:

 * Create a temporary directory on your server.
 * Upload and uncompress the package file in the temporary directory you create above.
 * In the Install Directory field specify the server directory where the temporary directory is.
 * Click on the Install button and Joomla! will install the contents of the given directory.
